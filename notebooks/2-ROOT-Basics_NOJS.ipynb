    "Look at one of your plots again and move the mouse across. You will notice that this is much more than a static picture, as the mouse pointer changes its shape when touching objects on the plot. When the mouse is over an object, a right-click opens a pull-down menu displaying in the top line the name of the ROOT class you are dealing with, e.g. [```TCanvas```](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTCanvas.html) for the display window itself, [```TFrame```](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v606/classTFrame.html) for the frame of the plot, [```TAxis```](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTAxis.html) for the axes, [```TPaveText```](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v606/classTPaveText.html) for the plot name. Depending on which plot you are investigating, menus for the ROOT classes ```TF1```, ```TGraphErrors``` or ```TH1F``` will show up when a right-click is performed on the respective graphical representations. The menu items allow direct access to the members of the various classes, and you can even modify them, e.g. change colour and size of the axis ticks or labels, the function lines, marker types and so on. Try it!\n",

    "\n",
    "You will probably like the following: in the output produced by the example ```slits.C```, right-click on the function line and select “SetLineAttributes”, then left-click on “Set Parameters”. This gives access to a panel allowing you to interactively change the parameters of the function, as shown in the figure above. Change the slit width, or go from one to two and then three or more slits, just as you like. When clicking on “Apply”, the function plot is updated to reflect the actual value of the parameters you have set.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ROOTPanel_FitPanel.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"700\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Another very useful interactive tool is the [```FitPanel```](https://root.cern.ch/fit-panel), available for the classes ```TGraphErrors``` and ```TH1F```. Predefined fit functions can be selected from a pull-down menu, including “```gaus```”, “```expo```” and “```pol0```” - “```pol9```” for Gaussian and exponential functions or polynomials of degree 0 to 9, respectively. In addition, user-defined functions using the same syntax as for functions with parameters are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting the initial parameters, a fit of the selected function to the data of a graph or histogram can be performed and the result displayed on the plot. The fit panel has a number of control options to select the fit method, fix or release individual parameters in the fit, to steer the level of output printed on the console, or to extract and display additional information like contour lines showing parameter correlations. As function fitting is of prime importance in any kind of data analysis, this topic will again show up later.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are satisfied with your plot, you probably want to save it. Just close all selector boxes you opened previously and select the menu item ```Save as...``` from the menu line of the window. It will pop up a file selector box to allow you to choose the format, file name and target directory to store the image. There is one very noticeable feature here: you can store a plot as a root macro! In this macro, you find the C++ representation of all methods and classes involved in generating the plot. This is a valuable source of information for your own macros, which you will hopefully write after having worked through this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using ROOT’s interactive capabilities is useful for a first exploration of possibilities. Other ROOT classes you will encounter in this tutorial have such graphical interfaces. We will not comment further on this, just be aware of the existence of ROOT’s interactive features and use them if you find them convenient. Some trial-and-error is certainly necessary to find your way through the huge number of menus and parameter settings.\n",

    "## 2.8 ROOT Beginners’ FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point of the guide, some basic questions could have already come to your mind. We will try to clarify some of them with further explanations in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.8.1 ROOT type declarations for basic data types\n",
    "\n",
    "In the official ROOT documentation, you find special data types replacing the normal ones, e.g. ```Double_t```, ```Float_t``` or ```Int_t``` replacing the standard ```double```, ```float``` or ```int``` types. Using the ROOT types makes it easier to port code between platforms (64/32 bit) or operating systems (windows/Linux), as these types are mapped to suitable ones in the ROOT header files. If you want adaptive code of this type, use the ROOT type declarations. However, usually you do not need such adaptive code, and you can safely use the standard C type declarations for your private code, as we did and will do throughout this guide. If you intend to become a ROOT developer, however, you better stick to the official coding rules!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.8.2 Configure ROOT at start-up\n",
    "\n",
    "The behaviour of a ROOT session can be tailored with the options in the ```.rootrc``` file. Examples of the tunable parameters are the ones related to the operating and window system, to the fonts to be used, to the location of start-up files. At start-up, ROOT looks for a ```.rootrc``` file in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```./.rootrc //local directory```\n",
    "* ```$HOME/.rootrc //user directory```\n",
    "* ```$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc //global ROOT directory```\n",
    "\n",
    "If more than one ```.rootrc``` files are found in the search paths above, the options are merged, with precedence local, user, global. The parsing and interpretation of this file is handled by the ROOT class TEnv. Have a look to its documentation if you need such rather advanced features. The file ```.rootrc``` defines the location of two rather important files inspected at start-up: ```rootalias.C``` and ```rootlogon.C```. They can contain code that needs to be loaded and executed at ROOT startup. ```rootalias.C``` is only loaded and best used to define some often used functions. rootlogon.C contains code that will be executed at startup: this file is extremely useful for example to pre-load a custom style for the plots created with ROOT. This is done most easily by creating a new TStyle object with your preferred settings, as described in the class reference guide, and then use the command ```gROOT->SetStyle(\"MyStyleName\");``` to make this new style definition the default one. As an example, have a look in the file rootlogon.C coming with this tutorial. Another relevant file is ```rootlogoff.C``` that it called when the session is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.8.3 ROOT command history\n",
    "\n",
    "Every command typed at the ROOT prompt is stored in a file ```.root_hist``` in your home directory. ROOT uses this file to allow for navigation in the command history with the up-arrow and down-arrow keys. It is also convenient to extract successful ROOT commands with the help of a text editor for use in your own macros.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.8.4 ROOT Global Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "All global pointers in ROOT begin with a small “g”. Some of them were already implicitly introduced (for example in the section Configure ROOT at start-up). The most important among them are presented in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[gROOT](http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TROOT.html):** the ```gROOT``` variable is the entry point to the ```ROOT``` system. Technically it is an instance of the ```TROOT``` class. Using the gROOT pointer one has access to basically every object created in a ROOT based program. The ```TROOT``` object is essentially a container of several lists pointing to the main ```ROOT``` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[gStyle](http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TStyle.html):** By default ROOT creates a default style that can be accessed via the ```gStyle``` pointer. This class includes functions to set some of the following object attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Canvas\n",
    "  * Pad\n",
    "  * Histogram axis\n",
    "  * Lines\n",
    "  * Fill areas\n",
    "  * Text\n",
    "  * Markers\n",
    "  * Functions\n",
    "  * Histogram Statistics and Titles\n",
    "  * etc …\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[gSystem](http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TSystem.html):** An instance of a base class defining a generic interface to the underlying Operating System, in our case ```TUnixSystem```.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[gInterpreter](http://root.cern.ch/htmldoc/html/TInterpreter.html):** The entry point for the ROOT interpreter. Technically an abstraction level over a singleton instance of ```TCling```.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you have already learnt quite a bit about some basic features of ROOT.\n",
