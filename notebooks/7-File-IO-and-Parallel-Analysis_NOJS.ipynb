    "ROOT offers the possibility to write instances of classes on disk, into a ROOT-file (see the [```TFile```](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTFile.html) class for more details). One says that the object is made “persistent” by storing it on disk. When reading the file back, the object is reconstructed in memory. The requirement to be satisfied to perform I/O of instances of a certain class is that the ROOT type system is aware of the layout in memory of that class. This topic is beyond the scope of this document: it is worth to mention that I/O can be performed out of the box for the almost complete set of ROOT classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "The processing of n-tuples via a selector function of type ```TSelector``` through ```TChain::Process()```, as described at the end of the previous section, offers an additional advantage in particular for very large data sets: on distributed systems or multi-core architectures, portions of data can be processed in parallel, thus significantly reducing the execution time. On modern computers with multi-core CPUs or hardware-threading enabled, this allows a much faster turnaround of analyses, since all the available CPU power is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "On distributed systems, a PROOF server and worker nodes have to be set up, as described in detail in the ROOT documentation. On a single computer with multiple cores, ```PROOF``` lite can be used instead. Try the following little macro, RunMySelector.C, which contains two extra lines compared to the example above (adjust the number of workers according to the number of CPU cores):\n",

    "\n",
    "The first command, ```TProof::Open(const char*)``` starts a local PROOF server (if no arguments are specified, all cores will be used), and the command ```ch->SetProof();``` enables processing of the chain using PROOF. Now, when issuing the command ```ch->Process(\"MySelector.C+);```, the code in ```MySelector.C``` is compiled and executed on each slave node. The methods ```Begin()``` and ```Terminate()``` are executed on the master only. The list of n-tuple files is analysed, and portions of the data are assigned to the available slave processes. Histograms booked in SlaveBegin() exist in the processes on the slave nodes, and are filled accordingly. Upon termination, the PROOF master collects the histograms from the slaves and merges them. In ```Terminate()``` all merged histograms are available and can be inspected, analysed or stored. The histograms are handled via the instances fOutput of class TList in each slave process, and can be retrieved from this list after merging in Terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the power of this mechanism, generate some very large n-tuples using the script from the section Storing Arbitrary N-tuples - you could try 10 000 000 events (this results in a large n-tuple of about 160 MByte in size). You could also generate a large number of files and use wildcards to add the to the TChain. Now execute: ```> root -l RunMySelector.C``` and watch what happens:\n",

    "\n",
    "ROOT automatically applies compression algorithms on n-tuples to reduce the memory consumption. A value that is in most cases the same will consume only small space on your disk (but it has to be decompressed on reading). Nevertheless, you should think about the design of your n-tuples and your analyses as soon as the processing time exceeds some minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try to keep your n-tuples simple and use appropriate variable types. If your measurement has only a limited precision, it is needless to store it with double precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Experimental conditions that do not change with every single measurement should be stored in a separate tree. Although the compression can handle redundant values, the processing time increase with every variable that has to be filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The function SetCacheSize(long) specifies the size of the cache for reading a TTree object from a file. The default value is 30MB. A manual increase may help in certain situations. Please note that the caching mechanism can cover only one TTree object per TFile object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can select the branches to be covered by the caching algorithm with AddBranchToCache and deactivate unneeded branches with SetBranchStatus. This mechanism can result in a significant speed-up for simple operations on trees with many branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can measure the performance easily with TTreePerfStats. The ROOT documentation on this class also includes an introductory example. For example, TTreePerfStats can show you that it is beneficial to store meta data and payload data separately, i.e. write the meta data tree in a bulk to a file at the end of your job instead of writing both trees interleaved."
